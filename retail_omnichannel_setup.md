# What Every Retailer Needs to Go Omnichannel

In today’s retail landscape, customers no longer shop through just one channel. They might discover a product on Instagram, compare prices on a website, and then walk into a store to try it on.

This shift in behavior has made it essential for retailers to adopt an omnichannel approach—a strategy that connects online and offline shopping experiences into one unified journey.

When a retailer decides to expand their business into an omnichannel setup, the goal is to provide a seamless shopping experience across both online and offline touchpoints. To do this effectively, they need to integrate several systems and tools. Here's a breakdown of the essentials:

---

## 1. E-commerce Platform  
To sell online, the retailer needs an e-commerce platform that allows them to manage products, customers, and orders.  
**e.g., Shopify**

---

## 2. Point of Sale (POS)  
For physical stores, a POS system is required to manage in-store transactions, sync inventory, and maintain customer records.  
**e.g., Shopify POS**

---

## 3. Warehouse Management System (WMS)  
A WMS helps track inventory levels, stock movements, and storage across warehouses and retail locations.  
**e.g., NetSuite WMS**

---

## [4. Order Management System (OMS)](trainingDocument/oms.md#4-order-management-system-oms)
 
The OMS sits between the channels (online/offline) and fulfillment centers. It allocates inventory, splits orders, handles cancellations/returns, and provides full order lifecycle tracking.  
**e.g., HotWax Commerce OMS**

---

## 5. Shipping Carrier Integration  
To deliver products, the business must integrate with reliable shipping partners who can handle domestic and international logistics.  
**e.g., FedEx**

---

## 6. Email Marketing and Automation  
To engage with customers, the retailer needs email tools that support campaigns, abandoned cart emails, product recommendations, and more.  
**e.g., Klaviyo**

---

## 7. Tax Management  
Managing tax calculations, regional rules, and filing can be complex. A tax solution ensures accuracy and compliance.  
**e.g., Avalara**

---

## 8. Payment Gateway  
To accept payments securely online and in-store, a trusted payment gateway is essential.  
**e.g., Stripe or Razorpay**

---

## 9. Analytics and Reporting  
To understand customer behavior, sales trends, and operational performance, analytics tools help the retailer make informed decisions.  
**e.g., Google Analytics**
