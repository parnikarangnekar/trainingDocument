# OMS Data Flow: Multi-line Order from Shopify

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

A customer places a multi-line order on **Shopify (mobile app)**. The order contains:

- **SKU 1**: `TSHIRT-RED-M`, Quantity: 2  
- **SKU 2**: `JEANS-BLUE-32`, Quantity: 1  

This order is ingested into **Hotwax OMS**, which stores data across multiple **UDM (Unified Data Model)** entities.

- The **Hotwax OMS order ID** is stored in `orderId`.  
- The **Shopify order ID** is stored in `externalId` of the `OrderHeader` entity.

## Entity-wise Data Representation

### OrderHeader
**Purpose:**  
Stores the main information about the order.

**Created When:**  
As soon as the order is placed by the customer (e.g., from website, POS, or API).

**Note:**  
Acts as the root of the order structure. All related items and statuses are linked to this.

##  Summary of Flow

1. **Shopify Order Created** â†’ Comes into OMS with an external ID.
2. **OrderHeader** is created with metadata.
3. **OrderItem** lines are created for each SKU.
4. A default **OrderItemShipGroup** (with `NA` facility) is created before brokering.
5. **OrderItemShipGrpAssoc** links each item to the ship group.
6. After brokering:
    - `facilityId` is updated in `OrderItemShipGroup`.
    - `OrderItemShipGrpInvRes` is created to reflect reserved inventory.
